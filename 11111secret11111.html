<h1>You found the secret page!</h1>
<p>Didn't expect anyone to see this.</p>
<p>If you're reading this you were most likely were told the instructions to reach this page by Dorian</p>
<p>This little area used to have an unblocker, but I removed it because it kind of stunk.</p>
<p>Im going to leave this page completely undecorated since most users of Dorian's Games will never find it.</p>
<p>Well you can go back to the main menu now. There's no more secrets on this page.</p>
<p>Or is there?</p>
<p>Look around, maybe, just maybe there's a little tiny surprise ;)</p>
